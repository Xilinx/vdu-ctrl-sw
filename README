Overview
========

The Allegro software consists of two parts:

- the control-software: user-mode code driving the encoding through a codec
  interface. It can be used to drive the hardware codec, or the software
  reference model.

- the software reference model: a software implementation of the hardware
  codec. The source code for this library is not delivered.

The control-software can be used as:
- a standalone command-line executable (see below).
- a library, whose entry point can be found in lib_encode and lib_decode

Requirements
============

- Linux kernel ≥ 4.2
- gcc ≥= 4.9.2
- python ≥= 3.7.3

============================
Allegro Software Source Code
============================

Overview
========

The Allegro software consists of two parts:

- the control-software: user-mode code driving the encoding through a codec
  interface. It can be used to drive the hardware codec, or the software
  reference model.

- the software reference model: a software implementation of the hardware
  codec. The source code for this library is not delivered.

The control-software can be used as:
- a standalone command-line executable (see below).
- a library, whose entry point can be found in lib_encode and lib_decode

How to build the documentation
==============================

$ cd src/CtrlSW/Doxygen/
$ ./doxygen.sh

firefox Doxygen/doc/html/index.html

How to build a fully-software encoder
=====================================

You need a working gcc/g++ toolchain installed.
Just run:

$ cd src/CtrlSW/
$ make

The resulting binaries will be available in the bin/ directory

You can test it on a very simple configuration with the following command:
$ ./bin/AL_Encoder -cfg test/config/encode_example.cfg

User Manual
===========

The encoder user manual is available in doc/html/index.html
